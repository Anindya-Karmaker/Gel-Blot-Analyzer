# Imaging-Assistant
This software makes it easy to modify SDS-PAGE, WB and other GEL images easily and add notations like label heading, molecular weight marker and so on. It can save the image with all of the options for easy editing and has copy/paste functionality for PRO users. I am not a professional coder and used ChatGPT to write most of the supporting code based on my algorithms and ideas. Please download the required libraries using requirements.txt. Used python version 3.9.13 on a M1 MacBook Pro to run and test the code.

Example output from the software:

Have option to predict the molecular weight of the protein once the ladder markers (left/right) are placed (Accurarcy can vary anywhere from 5 to 10% depending on the quality of the gel):
